## Description
**What was your motivation?** <br>
We wanted to design an application that provided foodies and homecooks to connect with one another and share new ideas. This database was designed by Lukas MacMillen and Jason Nguyen to provide full CRUD functionality to our react.js front end. <br><br>
**What problem does your project solve?** <br>
It gives home cooks a way to share their cooking, and find other talented home cooks with whom they can collaborate with. <br><br>
**What did you learn from this project?** <br>
For the back end, we learned how the npm Multer package turns images into buffer data, to then be read as base64strings. We wanted to learn how it works hands on, so we deconstructed Multer and created our own storage system for base64strings, created by imported images from the front-end. Additionally, we learned how to develop mongodb databases using mongoose, and we manged them with full crud functionallity.
